This is my fork of Twin. Twin is a tool for programmatic automation and testing of windows applications.
The documentation and the latest code can be found at:
  http://twin.googlecode.com/

However, twin does not work with a normal WebDriver implementation, eg. one used by Appium, as it uses a different API used by it's own java library.

The purpose of this repository is to reuse as much as the existing twin code as possible, whilst making it so that it can be accessed by other platforms/languages/frameworks.
